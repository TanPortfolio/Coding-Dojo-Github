Nathaniel,
Your Ninja Gold assignment looks really fantastic.  Most people don't take the time to split out the functionality the way you did.
I thoroughly enjoyed how you A) created additional functions to handle activities and whether or not you'd lose money at the casino 
and B) how you implemented winning or losing money at the casino.  It was very clean and it's the first time I've seen someone
accomplish Ninja Gold in this manner.  Keep it up.
