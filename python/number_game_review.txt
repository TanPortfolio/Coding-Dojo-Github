So I code reviewed Ninja Gold before this assignment and I'm thinking you had some serious fun doing these assignments, because 
yet again, you've done things I've not seen from your colleagues or anyone really.  The way you're handling all cases of inputs,
and using flash's category_filter is slick.  Listen Nathaniel, you're doing really well.  Honestly.  You're going above and beyond 
and it's inspiring.  Keep up the great work and keep refusing to do the bare minimum to get the assignments finished.
