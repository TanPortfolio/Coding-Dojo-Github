Alright,
Something I can provide guidance on!  Just going to copy in some of your code first...

# I like that you're setting up a turtles dictionary with all their corresponding colors and image files, smart!
turtles = {'red':'donatello.jpg', 'green':'leonardo.jpg', 'blue':'michelangelo.jpg', 'purple':'raphael.jpg', 'april': 'notapril.jpg'}

@app.route('/ninja', methods = ['GET'])
def index():
    data = turtles # Okay here's where I like the idea of creating a new copy of your turtles dictionary
    data.pop('april') # because here you are lopping off April, which is smart.
    contents = turtles # But here, I'm not sure why you're creating the contents variable to be a copy of the original turtles dictionary
    # as you are not really using it.  saying contents = data in your render_template function is all you need in this case.  contents is 
    # the keyword you get to use in your template.  You don't need to specify it like you did on line 11.
    return render_template('index.html', contents = data)

@app.route('/ninja/<turtle>', methods = ['GET'])
def show(turtle):
    data = {} 
    if turtle == 'red' or turtle == 'green' or turtle == 'blue' or turtle == 'purple':
    # I like this check ^^^^ but it can be made easier by saying if turtle in turtles..which will look for that key in the turtles dictionary.
        data[turtle] = turtles[turtle]
    else:
        data['april']=turtles['april']
    return render_template('index.html', contents = data)

# In general it's very good and I like how you even made it reliant upon just ONE template as opposed to the required two.  
# Yet again, going above and beyond.  Nicely done Nathaniel.
